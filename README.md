# SweetBerries-Cooking-School

This static project is a website for an online cooking course platform. 
It features a clean and intuitive design with distinct sections for navigation, a welcoming slogan, and highlighted cooking courses. 
The project effectively uses HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Header Section:
	The header includes a navigation bar with a prominent logo and navigation links "Courses," "About us," and "Get Started."
	For mobile layouts, a hamburger icon is implemented for a collapsible menu.

Slogan Section:
	The main section showcases a welcoming message and an image of people cooking.

Cards Container:
	A "cards-container" displays various cooking courses with individual cards.
	Each card contains an icon, course title, description, and a "Get Started" button.

Footer Section:
	The footer features a simple design with a centered logo image.

Mobile Layout:
	The website is designed to be responsive, adapting its layout for tablet and mobile screens.
	The navigation menu transforms into a mobile-friendly dropdown menu when the screen size is reduced.
	Font sizes, spacing, and image dimensions are adjusted for better readability and usability on smaller screens.

Here are some of the key concepts used in the project:

HTML Structure:
	Proper structuring of HTML elements to create a clear and semantic document.
	Use of header, main, and footer tags to organize different sections of the webpage.

Navigation Bar:
	Use of flexbox for easy positioning of navigation elements.

Mobile-Friendly Design:
	Incorporation of mobile-first design principles, ensuring a seamless experience on smaller screens.
	Utilization of media queries to adjust styles and layout for various devices, such as tablets and smartphones.

Grid Layout:
	Implementation of a grid layout for the "cards-container" section using grid-template-columns.

Flexbox:
	Use of flexbox to structure and align elements within the "slogan" section.
	
Checkbox Hack for Mobile Menu:
	Implementation of a checkbox input and label to create a toggleable mobile menu.
	Utilization of the :checked pseudo-class to conditionally display the menu.
